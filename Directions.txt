Application:
	If you press Run on Controller.java, the application that gets started
	is a frame where you can create different kind of bouncing balls on 
	the screen.
	
Direction:
	Use the drag down menu to choose the kind of ball you want to create
	and hit "Make Ball" to make them. There are in total 4 kinds of balls.
	They are: 
		- Straight 
			- Goes in straight directions and bounces normally.
		- ColorBreathing
			- Goes in straight directions, bounces normally. However the 
			  color and the size of the radius changes every time the frame
			  updates.
		- Trippy
			- Goes in a circular motion, bounces normally. However, the
			  color and size of the radius changes every time the frame
			  updates.
		- VelChange
		 	- Goes in straight directions, but every time it bounces off
		 	  a wall, the velocity either slows down or gets faster.
	
	If you use "Random", then any of the four balls above could show up.
	You can also choose to type directly into the text field instead of 
	using the drag down. However, note that if the names of the balls
	are not spelled exactly like they are in the drag down, an ErrorBall
	instance will be created and it will not display on the canvas.
	
	To clear all the balls that are on the screen, simply press the button
	"Clear All!".
	
	Also, feel free to resize the window frame. The balls do adjust accordingly
	to the frame.
